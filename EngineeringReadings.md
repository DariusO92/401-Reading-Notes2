## Act like you make $1000/hr

- “Pretend your time is worth $1,000/hr. Would you spend five of them doing extra work for free? Would you waste one on being angry?” -Niklas Göke
You have very few hours here on this earth.
Still, many people waste much of their time on pointless, low-quality activities that don’t help them reach their true goals — their mission.
The truth is, most people value their time at far, far less than it’s worth.
They say yes to things they have no business doing. They give away their talents, attention, and effort to others who take, take, take.
They spend hours watching low-quality television and social media when they should be productive and effective.
See, many people could be making a fortune (if they used their time well)…but instead, they give away their time in unproductive ways that leave them broke, unhappy, and stuck.


## How to think like a programmer

- Understand
   Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them (hence why this is the first step).
- Plan
  Don’t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution!
- Divide
  Pay attention. This is the most important step of all.
  Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry.
  Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.
  Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer (or are closer to that answer).
  After that, simplest means this sub-problem being solved doesn’t depend on others being solved.
  Once you solved every sub-problem, connect the dots.
  Connecting all your “sub-solutions” will give you the solution to the original problem. Congratulations!
