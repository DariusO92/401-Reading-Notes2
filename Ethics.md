## Microsoft Ai

- I liked what I read on Microsoft AI. They really seem to be forward thinking evoling with the current times. They have six princples that they follow but the two that really stuck out to me were
fairness and transparcy. They know that to build Ai programms that are they need to have a diverse team to be apart of the creation of it. They believe that the developer needs to know his intentions for making the Ai and it's limitations.
