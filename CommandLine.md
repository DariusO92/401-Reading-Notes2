# Command line

- Well doing this assignment I didnt really have alot of ah ha moments expect for one. When you need to look for a file and dont know exactly
  where you can just use the command man -k <filename>. That will save me alot of time from cd in and out looking for something.
- Another moment I had was in 'more about file' section. where I learned that linix is a extensionless system and it ignores extenion and looks inside the file to determine the type.
