### Growth Mindset
A grow mind set is one that if you **never stop putting in the work** to learn something new you will eventually master that subject.  

- **Get enough rest!**:bed:
- take 10 to 15 minute breaks every couple hours!
- If the work gets to challenging take a few moments and get your mind off work.
